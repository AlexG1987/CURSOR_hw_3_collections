Qestion:
Why arrays in java initialize with fixed size and can't be dynamic?

Answer: 
Arrays in java initialize like primitive data types with fixed memory limit counts like: primitive datatype memory limit * counts of elements (lenght).
So after initialization array has fixed memory limit.
If we want to resize array we must create a new one with bigger size and replace element from old to new one.
